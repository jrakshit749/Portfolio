# Portfolio
A portfolio where I showcase all my projects and achievements.
This portfolio is presented in a minimal fashion where I learn web dev and improve my fluency as a developer

## I am currently working on a different portfolio page hence this one is outdated. 

## Some of my skills include:

- I wield my brush as a conductor orchestrating a symphony of colors and emotions, painting my soul onto the canvas of existence.
- I possess expertise in the field of Applied Cryptography provided by a platform aka Coursera
- Keen about Blockchain
